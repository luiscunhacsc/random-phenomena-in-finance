    In quantitative finance, we need mathematical models that can accurately represent the behavior of financial assets.
    The prices of equities, currencies, commodities, and indices all exhibit both predictable trends and unpredictable fluctuations.
    
    There are three common approaches to analyzing financial markets:

    1. **Fundamental Analysis**: Studying a company's financials, management, competitive position, etc. to determine its "true" value.
    
    2. **Technical Analysis**: Examining price patterns and trading volumes to predict future movements.
    
    3. **Quantitative Analysis**: Treating financial quantities as random variables and developing mathematical models to describe their behavior.
    
    This guide focuses on the quantitative approach, which has formed the foundation for modern portfolio theory, derivatives pricing, and risk management.

    st.markdown(r"""
    To understand why modeling randomness is crucial, especially for derivatives pricing, we need to look at Jensen's inequality.
    
    Consider a simple example: A stock is currently priced at $100. After one year, it could either be worth $50 or $150, with equal probability.
    
    There are two ways we might try to value a call option with a strike price of $100:
    
    **Approach 1**: Take the expected future stock price and calculate the option payoff.
    - Expected future stock price = $100 (average of $50 and $150)
    - Call option payoff = $\max(S - K, 0) = \max(100 - 100, 0) = 0$
    
    **Approach 2**: Calculate the option payoff for each scenario and take the average.
    - If stock goes to $50: Payoff = $\max(50 - 100, 0) = 0$
    - If stock goes to $150: Payoff = $\max(150 - 100, 0) = 50$
    - Expected payoff = $(0 + 50)/2 = 25$
    
    The second approach gives a much higher value! This is Jensen's inequality in action:

    For a convex function $f(S)$ (like an option payoff) of a random variable $S$ (like a stock price), the expected value of the function is greater than or equal to the function of the expected value.
    
    This difference can be approximated as:

    Based on our observations of returns, we can develop a mathematical model for asset prices. We'll build this model step by step.
    
    ### The Random Walk Model

    """)

    - $\sigma$ is the volatility (standard deviation of returns)

    st.latex(r"S_{i+1} = S_i(1 + \mu \delta t + \sigma \phi \sqrt{\delta t})")
    
    st.markdown(r"""
    ### Scaling with Time
    
    A key insight is how the mean and standard deviation of returns scale with time:
    
    - Mean return scales linearly with time: $\text{mean} = \mu \delta t$
    - Standard deviation scales with the square root of time: $\text{std dev} = \sigma \sqrt{\delta t}$
    
    This scaling ensures that our model remains meaningful as we make the time step smaller.
    
    ### Continuous-Time Limit: The Wiener Process
    
    As we take the time step $\delta t$ to zero, we get the continuous-time model:
    """)
    
    st.latex(r"dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dX")
    
    st.markdown(r"""
    Where:
    - $dS$ is the infinitesimal change in the asset price
    - $dt$ is an infinitesimal time step
    - $dX$ is a Wiener process increment with $E[dX] = 0$ and $E[dX^2] = dt$
    
    This is a stochastic differential equation (SDE) known as Geometric Brownian Motion. It is the foundation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model and many other financial theories.
    
    ### Key Parameters
    
    **Drift ($\mu$)**: 
    - Represents the expected return of the asset
    - Usually quoted as an annualized percentage
    - Hard to estimate accurately from historical data due to noise
    
    **Volatility ($\sigma$)**:
    - Measures the standard deviation of returns
    - Usually quoted as an annualized percentage
    - More reliable to estimate than the drift
    - The most important parameter for options pricing

    ### Model Characteristics
    
    1. **Short vs. Long Term**:
       - In the short term, randomness (volatility) dominates
       - In the long term, the drift becomes more important
    
    2. **Log-Normal Distribution**:
       - The model implies that asset prices follow a log-normal distribution
       - This ensures prices remain positive
    
    3. **Independence of Returns**:
       - The model assumes each price change is independent of past changes
       - This is a simplification, as real markets may show autocorrelation
    
    4. **Constant Volatility**:
       - The basic model assumes constant volatility
       - More sophisticated models allow for time-varying volatility
    
    Despite its simplifications, this model works remarkably well for many financial applications and forms the foundation of modern quantitative finance.

    ### Understanding the Simulation
    
    The simulation implements the stochastic process:
    
    $$S_{i+1} = S_i(1 + \mu \delta t + \sigma \phi \sqrt{\delta t})$$
    
    Where $\phi$ is a random number drawn from a standard normal distribution.
    
    In the continuous limit, this becomes:
    
    $$dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dX$$
    
    This model has an analytical solution:
    
    $$S_T = S_0 \exp\left(\left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)T + \sigma \sqrt{T} Z\right)$$
    
    Where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. This implies that the logarithm of the asset price follows a normal distribution, or equivalently, that the asset price follows a log-normal distribution.

        As the number of tosses increases, the distribution approaches a normal distribution with 
        mean = {mean} and standard deviation = {std:.2f}.
        
        This demonstrates why the normal distribution appears naturally in finance - asset returns can be viewed as 
        the cumulative result of many small, independent random influences.
